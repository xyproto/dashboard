dashboard
=========


Simple dashboard web application skeleton, using:

* [permissions2](https://github.com/xyproto/permissions2)
* [martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini)
* [render](https://github.com/unrolled/render)

And:

* [Yahoo pure.css](http://purecss.io/)
* [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)

This works reasonably well, but in the future I think I'll negroni or gin over martini, boostrap over pure and a more lightweight library than Google Charts for charts. Other than that, I'm happy with the current choices.
